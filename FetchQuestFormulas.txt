Turn order is determined directly by AGILITY of Attacker
BaseAttackPower and BaseAttackAccuracy are determined by the Attack
STRENGTH, LUCK1 are determined by the Attacker
DEFENSE, STAMINA, PERCEPTION, DEXTERITY, LUCK2 are determined by the Defender
CriticalModifier is determined by a special trait or is "1" by default
AdditionalPowerStat and AdditionalAccuracyStat are determined by a special trait or are "0" by default

AttackPower = BaseAttackPower * (STRENGTH + AdditionalPowerStat)
CriticalChance = 0.05 + 0.002 * LUCK1
DamageTaken = AttackPower / (DEFENSE + AdditionalPowerStat) * CriticalPower
StaminaRemaining = STAMINA - DamageTaken
CriticalPower = 1  if  RandomNumber(0,100)>CriticalChance
CriticalPower = 1.5 * CriticalModifier if  RandomNumber(0,100)<=CriticalChance
AttackAccuracy = BaseAttackAccuracy * (PERCEPTION + AdditionalAccuracyStat)
AttackHitChance = AttackAccuracy / (DEXTERITY + (LUCK2 + AdditionalAccuracyStat)/2)
FleeChance = (PERCEPTION + AGILITY + DEXTERITY) / 3


STRENGTH     = BaseStrength     + StrengthInvestment     + WeaponPower
DEFENSE      = BaseDefense      + DefenseInvestment      + ArmorStrength
STAMINA      = BaseStamina      + StaminaInvestment      + ??
PERCEPTION   = BasePerception   + PerceptionInvestment   + WeatherFactors
DEXTERITY    = BaseDexterity    + DexterityInvestment    + EnvironmentalFactors
AGILITY      = BaseAgility      + AgilityInvestment      - ArmorWeight/2
LUCK         = BaseLuck         + LuckInvestment         + (ArmorLuck + ItemLuck)
CHARISMA     = BaseCharisma     + CharismaInvestment     + ArmorAppeal
INTELLIGENCE = BaseIntelligence + IntelligenceInvestment - (85 - (200/[Math.PI]) * arctan(CurrentStaminaPercent / 25) )
CRAFTINESS   = BaseCraftiness   + CraftinessInvestment   + ItemAssistance

Notes on INTELLIGENCE
	the last part of INTELLIGENCE is asymptotic to 0
		As CurrentStaminaPercent gets closer to 100 , (85 - ... arctan(...) ) gets closer to Zero
	INTELLIGENCE will decrease as the player's energy decreases
	This curve can be easily adjusted
	Maybe it would be necessary to do this for Strength, Agility, Dexterity, and Perception too? 
		Or would we just go with a "Fight to the last breath" or adrenaline-fueled fight or flight sort of thing?
