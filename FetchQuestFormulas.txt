COMBAT CHECKS
Turn order is determined directly by AGILITY of Attacker
BaseAttackPower and BaseAttackAccuracy are determined by the Attack
STRENGTH, LUCK1 are determined by the Attacker
DEFENSE, STAMINA, PERCEPTION, DEXTERITY, LUCK2 are determined by the Defender
CriticalModifier is determined by a special trait or is "1" by default
AdditionalPowerStat and AdditionalAccuracyStat are determined by a special trait or are "0" by default
CurrentStamina = STAMINA by default

AttackPower = BaseAttackPower * (STRENGTH + AdditionalPowerStat)
CriticalChance = 0.05 + 0.002 * LUCK1
DamageTaken = AttackPower / (DEFENSE + AdditionalPowerStat) * CriticalPower
CurrentStamina = CurrentStamina - DamageTaken
CriticalPower = 1  if  RandomNumber(0,100)>CriticalChance
CriticalPower = 1.5 * CriticalModifier if  RandomNumber(0,100)<=CriticalChance
AttackAccuracy = BaseAttackAccuracy * (PERCEPTION + AdditionalAccuracyStat)
AttackHitChance = AttackAccuracy / (DEXTERITY + (LUCK2 + AdditionalAccuracyStat)/2)
FleeChance = (PERCEPTION + AGILITY + DEXTERITY) / 3



PLAYER STATS
Base Stats are all determined by Breed
Investment is the accumulation of points placed into that stat upon each level-up
WeaponPower is the total power of all weapons that the are equipped (Max 2 weapons?)
ArmorStrength, ArmorWeight, ArmorLuck, ArmorAppeal, ArmorAssistance
	are determined by the total of these stats for all equipped armor
WeatherFactors and EnvironmentalFactors are determined by the current location
ItemLuck, ItemAssistance, ItemWeight, ItemAppeal are determined by the total of these stats for all held items
(BaseStrength + StrengthInvestment) is capped at 100 as with all other (Base... + ...Investment)

CarryingWeight = ItemWeight + ArmorWeight
CurrentStaminaPercent = (CurrentStamina + STAMINA) * 100

STRENGTH     = BaseStrength     + StrengthInvestment     + WeaponPower
DEFENSE      = BaseDefense      + DefenseInvestment      + ArmorStrength
STAMINA      = BaseStamina      + StaminaInvestment      + ??
PERCEPTION   = BasePerception   + PerceptionInvestment   + WeatherFactors
DEXTERITY    = BaseDexterity    + DexterityInvestment    + EnvironmentalFactors
AGILITY      = BaseAgility      + AgilityInvestment      - CarryingWeight/2
LUCK         = BaseLuck         + LuckInvestment         + (ArmorLuck + ItemLuck)
CHARISMA     = BaseCharisma     + CharismaInvestment     + (ArmorAppeal + ItemAppeal)
INTELLIGENCE = BaseIntelligence + IntelligenceInvestment - (85 - (200/[Math.PI]) * arctan(CurrentStaminaPercent / 25) )
CRAFTINESS   = BaseCraftiness   + CraftinessInvestment   + (ArmorAssistance + ItemAssistance)

Notes on INTELLIGENCE
	the last part of INTELLIGENCE is asymptotic to 0
		As CurrentStaminaPercent gets closer to 100 , (85 - ... arctan(...) ) gets closer to Zero
	INTELLIGENCE will decrease as the player's energy decreases
	This curve can be easily adjusted
	Maybe it would be necessary to do this for Strength, Agility, Dexterity, and Perception too? 
		Or would we just go with a "Fight to the last breath" or adrenaline-fueled fight or flight sort of thing?
		Instincts may be an easy excuse to ignore this



OTHER CHECKS AND THINGS
ObjectDurability is determined by the object that the player is interacting with in the world

LockPickedChance = 0.10 + 0.005*CRAFTINESS + 0.0015*LUCK 	//Base chance of 10%, Max Chance of 75%
ObjectDestroyedChance = 					//Base Chance of 05%, Max Chance of 95%
	0.05 + 0.0075*STRENGTH + (32 / [Math.PI] * arctan(CurrentStaminaPercent / 10) )
